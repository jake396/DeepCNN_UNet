# Fringe Pattern Denoising using Deep CNN and U-Net

This repository contains the implementation of **Deep CNN** and **U-Net** architectures for denoising fringe patterns in optical metrology.

## Features
- **Deep CNN** with convolution + ReLU + batch normalization layers
- **U-Net** with skip connections for fringe detail preservation
- Synthetic dataset generation of using **Zernike phase maps** + Gaussian noise
- The models have been trained on 1600 images and 16 epochs due to limited availability of resources
- Evaluation metrics: **SNR**
